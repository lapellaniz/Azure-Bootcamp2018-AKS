# Configure Readiness Probes

Readiness and liveness probes can be configured for Kubernetes deployments to:

* Enable zero downtime deploys
* Ensure that failed containers are automatically restarted
* Prevent HTTP requests until the application is ready

## Readiness Probes

With readiness probes, Kubernetes will not send traffic to a pod until the probe is successful. When updating a deployment, it will also leave old replica(s) running until probes have been successful on new replica. That means that if your new pods are broken in some way, theyâ€™ll never see traffic, your old pods will continue to serve all traffic for the deployment.

## Liveness Probes

Liveness probes will attempt to restart a pod if it fails.

### Settings

* `initialDelaySeconds` How long to wait before sending a probe after a container starts.
* `timeoutSeconds` How long a request can take to respond before itâ€™s considered a failure.
* `periodSeconds` How often a probe will be sent

### Probes for HTTP Services

```
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /monitoring/alive
    port: 3401
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  timeoutSeconds: 1
  periodSeconds: 15
```

### Probes for non-HTTPServices

```
readinessProbe:
  exec:
    command:
        - test
        - '`find . -name Status.txt`'
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 15
```          

### Get Ready Status via Kubectl

```
kubectl get pod lraimageprocessorservice-0
NAME                         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
lraimageprocessorservice-0   0/1       Running   0          6s

kubectl get pod lraimageprocessorservice-0
NAME                         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
lraimageprocessorservice-0   1/1       Running   0          1m

kubectl get pod lraimageprocessorservice-0
NAME                         READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
lraimageprocessorservice-0   1/1       Terminating   0          3m

kubectl get pod lraimageprocessorservice-0
NAME                         READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
lraimageprocessorservice-0   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          2s
```
